Notes on Git------Day 2

Till now, I have commited two html files on GitHub
One with staging and one without staging

Staging is recommended as it gives us a chance to check again if we missed something
Commiting without skips the staging step an directly add the code

To get our code, file or document on GitHub, we need to "Push" the code
to the directory/ branch where we want our code or file to show.

----Day 2---
Starting with Git Branch:

there can be different branches within the main file
